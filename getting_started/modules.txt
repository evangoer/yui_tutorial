Modules and Sandboxing
**********************

.. comments:
	without module loading
	- you have a large blocking script for core features (most other ajax libraries work like this)
	- to add more features, you call multiple blocking scripts
	- if you add your scripts to the page out of order, dependencies fail
	- lots of wasted code in giant monolithic scripts
	- "volatility in collaborative environments" -- ask Luke what he means, is this "no sandbox"?
	
	YUI 3 module loading
	- one small script, yui-min.js
	- call in everything else as needed with use()
	- dependencies automatically resolved
	- asynchronously comboloaded from CDN -- we make one, nonblocking HTTP request
	- sandboxed code: one page, N applications, can't step on each other's toes
	
	After this point, we ditch SimpleYUI
